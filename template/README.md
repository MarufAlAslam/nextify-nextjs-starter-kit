Welcome to **Nextify**! This is the ultimate starter kit for quickly setting up Next.js projects with pre-configured tools, optimized structure, and best practices. Whether you're building a simple app or a complex web application, **Nextify** gives you everything you need to get started.

## Features:
- Pre-configured Next.js setup with the latest features.
- Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling.
- Optimized folder structure.
- Pre-installed npm scripts for easy development and production.
- Fully responsive design ready for any screen size.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Create a New Nextify App

Run the following command in your terminal to create a new project using the **Nextify** starter kit:

```bash
nextify-app app-name
```

This will create a new Next.js project in a folder named `app-name`.

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

Navigate to the newly created app folder and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
cd app-name
npm install
```

### Step 3: Run the Development Server

After installation, start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will launch the app in your default web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Step 4: Customize and Build

Now youâ€™re ready to start building your project! You can modify the existing components, pages, and styles to fit your needs. 

### Step 5: Create a Production Build

To create a production build of your app, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

Then, you can start the production server with:

```bash
npm run start
```
